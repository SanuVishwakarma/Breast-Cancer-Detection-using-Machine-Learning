# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
## Goal of the ML project
- We have extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells. As a Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist has to create an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor. To complete this ML project we are using the supervised machine learning classifier algorithm.
We have completed the Machine learning Project successfully with 98.24% accuracy which is great for ‘Breast Cancer Detection using Machine learning’ project. Now, we are ready to deploy our ML model in the healthcare project.
